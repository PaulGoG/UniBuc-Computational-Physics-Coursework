# the height and each auxiliary strip (ratio, residual) about 180. Scripts scale
# up from these values where a figure needs it and never below them: no
# `fontsize`, `linewidth` or `markersize` override may undercut the theme,

    logticks(e_min, e_max; step = 1, style = :auto)

Explicit decade ticks for a base-10 logarithmic axis running from `10^e_min` to
`10^e_max`, returned as the `(values, labels)` tuple an `Axis` takes.

Spans of four decades or fewer are labelled as plain decimals (`0.01, 0.1, 1,
10`) provided the decades themselves stay within `10^-4` to `10^4`, beyond which
a decimal is a run of zeros and the power of ten is the readable form; wider
spans use powers of ten throughout. Pass `style = :decimal` or `style = :power`
to override the choice.

Every logarithmic axis in this repository sets its ticks through this function.
Left to itself Makie labels the unit decade as `10^0` on some axes and as `1` on
others, and on ranges narrower than a decade it falls back to fractional
exponents such as `10^{-0.4}`, which is not a form any of these quantities are
read in.

In the power style the unit decade is still written `1` and the first `10`, as
[`sci`](@ref) writes them: `10^{-2}, 1, 10^{2}`.
